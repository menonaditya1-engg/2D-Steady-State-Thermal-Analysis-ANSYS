# 2D Steady-State Thermal Analysis using ANSYS

Finite Element analysis of steady-state 2D heat conduction with internal heat generation and mixed boundary conditions.

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project investigates steady-state heat conduction in a two-dimensional plate using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The model includes internal heat generation and mixed thermal boundary conditions to represent realistic heat transfer scenarios. The objective is to evaluate the temperature distribution, identify hotspot locations, and study how material properties and boundary conditions influence the maximum temperature. The analysis is performed in ANSYS Mechanical and validated using mesh independence and global energy balance checks.


## 2. Problem Definition

A rectangular 2D plate is subjected to internal volumetric heat generation and an imposed heat flux at the bottom boundary. Heat is removed through a fixed-temperature boundary on the left edge and convective heat transfer on the right edge, while the top boundary is insulated. The system is analyzed under steady-state conditions to determine the temperature field and peak temperature within the plate.


## 3. Geometry and Assumptions

- Plate dimensions: 200 mm × 100 mm  
- Analysis performed as a 2D planar model with unit thickness  
- Steady-state thermal conditions (no time dependence)  
- Material properties assumed constant  
- Radiation effects neglected  
- Heat transfer occurs only through specified boundaries
